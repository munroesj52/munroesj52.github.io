<h1><a class="anchor" id="mainpage_rationale"></a>
Rationale</h1>
<p>The C/C++ language compilers (that support PowerISA) may implement vector intrinsic functions (compiler built-ins as embodied by altivec.h). These vector intrinsics offer an alternative to assembler programming, but do little to reduce the complexity of the underlying PowerISA. Higher level vector intrinsic operations are needed to improve productivity and encourage developers to optimize their applications for PowerISA. Another key goal is to smooth over the complexity of the evolving PowerISA and compiler support.</p>
<p>For example: the PowerISA 2.07 (POWER8) provides population count and count leading zero operations on vectors of byte, halfword, word, and doubleword elements but not on the whole vector as a __int128 value. Before PowerISA 2.07, neither operation was supported, for any element size.</p>
<p>Another example: The original <b>Altivec</b> (AKA Vector Multimedia Extension (<b>VMX</b>)) provided Vector Multiply Odd / Even operations for signed / unsigned byte and halfword elements. The PowerISA 2.07 added Vector Multiply Even/Odd operations for signed / unsigned word elements. This release also added a Vector Multiply Unsigned Word Modulo operation. This was important to allow auto vectorization of C loops using 32-bit (int) multiply.</p>
<p>But PowerISA 2.07 did not add support for doubleword or quadword (__int128) multiply directly. Nor did it fill in the missing multiply modulo operations for byte and halfword. However it did add support for doubleword and quadword add / subtract modulo, This can be helpful, if you are willing to apply grade school arithmetic (add, carry the 1) to vector elements.</p>
<p>PowerISA 3.0 (POWER9) did add a Vector Multiply-Sum Unsigned Doubleword Modulo operation. With this instruction (and a generated vector of zeros as input) you can effectively implement the simple doubleword integer multiply modulo operation in a few instructions. Similarly for Vector Multiply-Sum Unsigned Halfword Modulo. But this may not be obvious.</p>
<p>This history embodies a set of trade-offs negotiated between the Software and Processor design architects at specific points in time. But most programmers would prefer to use a set of operators applied across the supported element types and sizes.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="mainpage_sub0"></a>
POWER Vector Library Goals</h2>
<p>Obviously many useful operations can be constructed from existing PowerISA operations and GCC &lt;altivec.h&gt; built-ins but the implementation may not be obvious. The optimum sequence will vary across the PowerISA levels as new instructions are added. And finally the compiler's built-in support for new PowerISA instructions evolves with the compiler's release cycle.</p>
<p>So the goal of this project is to provide well crafted implementations of useful vector and large number operations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide equivalent functions across versions of the PowerISA. This includes some of the most useful vector instructions added to POWER9 (PowerISA 3.0B). Many of these operations can be implemented as inline function in a few vector instructions on earlier PowerISA versions.</li>
<li>Provide equivalent functions across versions of the compiler. For example built-ins provided in later versions of the compiler can be implemented as inline functions with inline asm in earlier compiler versions.</li>
<li>Provide complete arithmetic operations across supported C types. For example multiply modulo and even/odd for int, long, and __int128.</li>
<li>Provide complete extended arithmetic (carry / extend / multiple high) operations across supported C types. For example add / subtract with carry and extend for int, long, and __int128.</li>
<li>Provide higher order functions not provided directly by the PowerISA. For example vector SIMD implementation for ASCII __isalpha, etc. As another example full __int128 implementations of Count Leading Zeros, Population Count, Shift left/right immediate, and integer divide.</li>
<li>Such implementations should be small enough to inline and allow the compiler opportunity to apply common optimization techniques.</li>
</ul>

<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The list above is complete in the current public github as a first pass. A backlog of functions remain to be implemented across these headers. Development continues while we work on the backlog listed in: <a href="https://github.com/open-power-sdk/pveclib/issues/13">Issue #13 TODOs</a></dd></dl>
<p>The goal is to provide high quality implementations that adapt to the specifics of the compile target (-mcpu=) and compiler (&lt;altivec.h&gt;) version you are using. Initially pveclib will focus on the GCC compiler and -mcpu=[power7|power8|power9] for Linux. Testing will focus on Little Endian (<b>powerpc64le</b> for power8 and power9 targets. Any testing for Big Endian (<b>powerpc64</b> will be initially restricted to power7 and power8 targets.</p>
<p>Expanding pveclib support beyond this list to include:</p><ul>
<li>additional compilers (ie Clang)</li>
<li>additional PPC platforms (970, power6, ...)</li>
<li>Larger functions that just happen to use vector registers (Checksum, Crypto, compress/decompress, lower precision neural networks, ...)</li>
</ul>
<p>will largely depend on additional skilled practitioners joining this project and contributing (code and platform testing) on a sustained basis.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="mainpage_sub1"></a>
How pveclib is different from compiler vector built-ins</h2>
<p>The PowerPC vector built-ins evolved from the original <a href="https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/reference-manual/ALTIVECPIM.pdf">AltiVec (TM) Technology Programming Interface Manual</a> (PIM). The PIM defined the minimal extensions to the application binary interface (ABI) required to support the Vector Facility. This included new keywords (vector, pixel, bool) for defining new vector types, and new operators (built-in functions) required for any supporting and compliant C language compiler.</p>
<p>The vector built-in function support included:</p><ul>
<li>generic AltiVec operations, like vec_add()</li>
<li>specific AltiVec operations (instructions, like vec_vaddubm())</li>
<li>predicates computed from AltiVec operations, like vec_all_eq() which are also generic</li>
</ul>
<p>See <a class="el" href="index.html#mainpage_sub2">Background on the evolution of &lt;altivec.h&gt;</a> for more details.</p>
<p>There are clear advantages with the compiler implementing the vector operations as built-ins:</p><ul>
<li>The compiler can access the C language type information and vector extensions to implement the function overloading required to process generic operations.</li>
<li>Built-ins can be generated inline, which eliminates function call overhead and allows more compact code generation.</li>
<li>The compiler can then apply higher order optimization across built-ins including: Local and global register allocation. Global common subexpression elimination. Loop-invariant code motion.</li>
<li>The compiler can automatically select the best instructions for the <em>target</em> processor ISA level (from the -mcpu compiler option).</li>
</ul>
<p>While this is an improvement over writing assembler code, it does not provide much function beyond the specific operations specified in the PowerISA.</p>
<p>Another issue is that generic operations were not uniformly applicable across vector types. For example:</p><ul>
<li>vec_add / vec_sub applied to float, int, short and char.</li>
<li>Later compilers added support for double (with POWER7 and the Vector Scalar Extensions (VSX) facility)</li>
<li>Integer long (64-bit) and __int128 support for POWER8 (PowerISA 2.07B).</li>
</ul>
<p>But vec_mul / vec_div did not:</p><ul>
<li>vec_mul applied to float (and later double, with POWER7 VSX).</li>
<li>vec_mule / vec_mulo (Multiply even / odd elements) applied to [signed | unsigned] integer short and char. Later compilers added support for vector int after POWER8 added vector multiply word instructions.</li>
<li>vec_div was not included in the original PIM as Altivec (VMX) only included vector reciprocal estimate for float and no vector integer divide for any size. Later compilers added support for vec_div float / double after POWER7 (VSX) added vector divide single/double-precision instructions.</li>
</ul>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>While the processor you (plan to) use, may support the specific instructions you want to exploit, the compiler you are using may not support, the generic or specific vector operations, for the element size/types, you want to use. This is common for GCC versions installed by "Enterprise Linux" distributions. They tend to freeze the GCC version early and maintain that GCC version for long term stability. One solution is to use the <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/linuxonpower/advance-toolchain/">IBM Advance toolchain for Linux on Power</a> (AT). AT is free for download and new AT versions are released yearly (usually in August) with the latest stable GCC from that spring.</dd></dl>
<p>This all can be very frustrating, at minimum, or even a show stopper, if you are on a tight schedule for your project. Especially if you are not familiar with the evolving history of the PowerISA and supporting compilers.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="mainpage_sub_1_1"></a>
What can we do about this?</h3>
<p>First the Binutils assembler is usually updated within weeks of the public release of the PowerISA document. So while your compiler may not support the latest vector operations as built-in operations, an older compiler with an updated assembler, may support the instructions as inline assembler.</p>
<p>Sequences of inline assembler instructions can be wrapped within C language static inline functions and placed in a header files for shared use. If you are careful with the input / output register <em>constraints</em> the GCC compiler can provide local register allocation and minimize parameter marshaling overhead. This is very close (in function) to a specific Altivec (built-in) operation.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>Using GCC's inline assembler can be challenging even for the experienced programmer. The register constraints have grown in complexity as new facilities and categories were added. The fact that some (VMX) instructions are restricted to the original 32 Vector Registers (<b>VRs</b>) (the high half of the Vector-Scalar Registers <b>VSRs</b>), while others (Binary and Decimal Floating-Point) are restricted to the original 32 Floating-Point Registers (<b>FPRs</b> (overlapping the low half of the VSRs), and the new VSX instructions can access all 64 VSRs, is just one source of complexity. So it is very important to get your input/output constraints correct if you want inline assembler code to work correctly.</dd></dl>
<p>In-line assembler should be reserved for the first implementation using the latest PowerISA. Where possible you should use existing vector built-ins to implement specific operations for wider element types, support older hardware, or higher order operations. Again wrapping these implementations in static inline functions for collection in header files for reuse and distribution is recommended.</p>
<p>The PowerISA vector facility has all the instructions you need to implement extended precision operations for add, subtract, and multiply. Add / subtract with carry-out and permute or double vector shift and grade-school arithmetic is all you need.</p>
<p>For example the Vector Add Unsigned Quadword Modulo introduced in POWER8 (PowerISA 2.07B) can be implemented for POWER7 and earlier machines in 10-11 instructions. This uses a combination of Vector Add Unsigned Word Modulo (vadduwm), Vector Add and Write Carry-Out Unsigned Word (vaddcuw), and Vector Shift Left Double by Octet Immediate (vsldoi), to propagate the word carries through the quadword.</p>
<p>For POWER8 and later, C vector integer (modulo) multiply can be implemented in a single Vector Unsigned Word Modulo (<b>vmuluwm</b>) instruction. This was added explicitly to address vectorizing loops using int multiply in C language code. And some newer compilers do support generic vec_mul() for vector int. But this is not documented. Similarly for char (byte) and short (halfword) elements.</p>
<p>POWER8 also introduced Vector Multiply Even Signed Word (<b>vmulesw</b>) and Vector Multiply Odd Signed Word (<b>vmulosw</b>) instructions. So you would expect the generic vec_mule and vec_mulo operations to be extended to support <em>vector int</em>, as these operations have long been supported for char and short. Sadly this is not supported as of GCC 7.3. We hope to see this implemented for GCC 8.</p>
<p>So what will the compiler do for vector multiply int (modulo, even, or odd) for targeting power7? Older compilers will reject this as a <em>invalid parameter combination ...</em>. A newer compiler may implement the equivalent function in a short sequence of VMX instructions from PowerISA 2.06 or earlier. And GCC 7.3 does support vec_mul for element types char, short, and int. These sequences are in the 2-7 instruction range depending on the operation and element type. This includes some constant loads and permute control vectors that can be factored and reused across operations.</p>
<p>Once the pattern is understood it is not hard to write equivalent sequences using operations from the original &lt;altivec.h&gt;. With a little care these sequences will be compatible with older compilers and older PowerISA versions. These concepts can be extended to operations that PowerISA and the compiler does not support yet. For example; a processor that may not have multiply even/odd/modulo of the required width (word, doubleword, or quadword). This might take 10-12 instructions to implement the next element size bigger then the current processor. A full 128-bit by 128-bit multiply with 256-bit result only requires 32 instructions on a POWER8 (using multiple word even/odd).</p>
<p>Also many of the operations missing from the vector facility, exist in the Fixed-point, Floating-point, or Decimal Floating-point scalar facilities. There will be some loss of efficiency in the data transfer but compared to a complex operation like divide or decimal conversions, this can be a workable solution. On older POWER processors (before power7/8) transfers between register banks (GPR, FPR, VR) had to go through memory. But with the VSX facility (POWER7) FPRs and VRs overlap with the lower and upper halves of the 64 VSR registers. So FPR &lt;-&gt; VSR transfer are 0-2 cycles latency. And with power8 we have direct transfer (GPR &lt;-&gt; FPR | VR | VSR) instructions in the 4-5 cycle latency range.</p>
<p>For example POWER8 added Binary Coded Decimal (<b>BCD</b>) add/subtract for signed 31 digit vector values. The vector unit does not support BCD multiply / divide. But the Decimal Floating-Point (<b>DFP</b>) facility (introduced with PowerISA 2.05 and Power6) supports up to 34-digit (__Decimal128) precision and all the expected (add/subtract/multiply/divide/...) arithmetic operations. DFP also supports conversion to/from 31-digit BCD and __Decimal128 precision. This is all supported with a hardware Decimal Floating-Point Unit (<b>DFU</b>).</p>
<p>So bcd_add / bcd_sub can be generated as a single instruction on POWER8 and later, and 10-11 instructions for Power6/7. This count include the VSR &lt;-&gt; FPRp transfers, BCD &lt;-&gt; DFP conversions, and DFP add/sub. Similarly bcd_mul / bcd_div are implemented in 11 instructions using register transfer and the DFU operations for Power6/7/8.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>So why does anybody care about BCD and DFP? Sometimes you get large numbers in decimal that you need converted to binary for extended computation. Sometimes you need to display the results of your extended binary computation in decimal. The multiply by 10 and BCD vector operations help simplify and speed-up these conversions.</dd></dl>
<p>And finally: Henry S. Warren's wonderful book Hacker's Delight provides inspiration for SIMD versions of; count leading zeros, population count, parity, etc.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="mainpage_endian_issues_1_1"></a>
General Endian Issues</h3>
<p>For POWER8, IBM made the explicit decision to support Little Endian (<b>LE</b>) data format in the Linux ecosystem. The goal was to enhance application code portability across Linux platforms. This goal was integrated into the OpenPOWER ELF V2 Application Binary Interface <b>ABI</b> specification.</p>
<p>The POWER8 processor architecturally supports an <em>Endian Mode</em> and supports both BE and LE storage access in hardware. However, register to register operations are not effected by endian mode. The ABI extends the LE storage format to vector register (logical) element numbering. See OpenPOWER ABI specification <a href="http://openpowerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/resources/leabi/content/dbdoclet.50655244_pgfId-1095944.html">Chapter 6. Vector Programming Interfaces</a> for details.</p>
<p>This has no effect for most altivec.h operations where the input elements and the results "stay in their
   lanes". For operations of the form (T[n] = A[n] op B[n]), it does not matter if elements are numbered [0, 1, 2, 3] or [3, 2, 1, 0].</p>
<p>But there are cases where element renumbering can change the results. Changing element numbering does change the even / odd relationship for merge and integer multiply. For <b>LE</b> targets, operations accessing even vector elements are implemented using the equivalent odd instruction (and visa versa) and inputs are swapped. Similarly for high and low merges. Inputs are also swapped for Pack, Unpack, and Permute operations and the permute select vector is inverted. The above is just a sampling of a larger list of <em>LE transforms</em>. The OpenPOWER ABI specification provides a helpful table of <a href="http://openpowerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/resources/leabi/content/dbdoclet.50655244_90667.html">Endian-Sensitive Operations</a>.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>This means that the vector built-ins provided by altivec.h may not generate the instructions you expect.</dd></dl>
<p>This does matter when doing extended precision arithmetic. Here we need to maintain most-to-least significant byte order and align "digit" columns for summing partial products. Many of these operations where defined long before Little Endian was seriously considered and are decidedly Big Endian in register format. Basically, any operation where the element changes size (truncated, extended, converted, subseted) from input to output is suspect for <b>LE</b> targets.</p>
<p>The coding for these higher level operations is complicated by <em>Little Endian</em> (LE) support as specified in the OpenPOWER ABI and as implemented in the compilers. Little Endian changes the effective vector element numbering and the location of even and odd elements.</p>
<p>This is a general problem for using vectors to implement extended precision arithmetic. The multiply even/odd operations being the primary example. The products are double-wide and in BE order in the vector register. This is reinforced by the Vector Add/Subtract Unsigned Quadword instructions. And the products from multiply even instructions are always <em>numerically</em> higher digits then multiply odd products. The pack, unpack, and sum operations have similar issues.</p>
<p>This matters when you need to align (shift) the partial products or select the <em>numeric</em> high or lower portion of the products. The (high to low) order of elements for the multiply has to match the order of the largest element size used in accumulating partial sums. This is normally a quadword (vadduqm instruction).</p>
<p>So the element order is fixed while the element numbering and the partial products (between even and odd) will change between BE and LE. This effects splatting and octet shift operations required to align partial product for summing. These are the places where careful programming is required, to nullify the compilers LE transforms, so we will get the correct numerical answer.</p>
<p>So what can the Power Vector Library do to help?</p><ul>
<li>Be aware of these mandated LE transforms and if required provide compliant inline assembler implementations for LE.</li>
<li>Where required for correctness provide LE specific implementations that have the effect of nullifying the unwanted transforms.</li>
<li>Provide higher level operations that help pveclib and applications code in an endian neutral way and get correct results.</li>
</ul>

So what can the Power Vector Library project do?</h3>
<p>Clearly the PowerISA provides multiple, extensive, and powerful computational facilities that continue to evolve and grow. But the best instruction sequence for a specific computation depends on which POWER processor(s) you have or plan to support. It can also depend on the specific compiler version you use, unless you are willing to write some of your application code in assembler. Even then you need to be aware of the PowerISA versions and when specific instructions where introduced. This can be frustrating if you just want to port your application to POWER for a quick evaluation.</p>
<p>So you would like to start evaluating how to leverage this power for key algorithms at the heart of your application.</p><ul>
<li>But you are working with an older POWER processor (until the latest POWER box is delivered).</li>
<li>Or the latest POWER machine just arrived at your site (or cloud) but you are stuck using an older/stable Linux distro version (with an older distro compiler).</li>
<li>Or you need extended precision multiply for your crypto code but you are not really an assembler level programmer (or don't want to be).</li>
<li>Or you would like to program with higher level operations to improve your own productivity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Someone with the right background (knowledge of the PowerISA, assembler level programming, compilers and the vector built-ins, ...) can solve any of the issues described above. But you don't have time for this.</p>
<p>There should be an easier way to exploit the POWER vector hardware without getting lost in the details. And this extends beyond classical vector (Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD)) programming to exploiting larger data width (128-bit and beyond), and larger register space (64 x 128 Vector Scalar Registers)</p>

This is the first processor and PowerISA level to support vector quadword add/subtract. Otherwise we need to use the vector word add modulo and vector word add and write carry-out word, to add 32-bit chunks and propagate the carries through the quadword.</p>
<p>One little detail remains. Support for vec_vadduqm was added to GCC in March of 2014, after GCC 4.8 was released and GCC 4.9's feature freeze. So the only guarantee is that this feature is in GCC 5.0 and later. At some point this change was backported to GCC 4.8 and 4.9 as it is included in the current GCC 4.8/4.9 documentation. When or if these backports where propagated to a specific Linux Distro version or update is difficult to determine. So support for this vector built-in dependes on the specific version of the GCC compiler, or if specific Distro update includes these specific backports for the GCC 4.8/4.9 compiler they support. The:</p><div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="preprocessor">#ifndef vec_vadduqm</span></div></div><!-- fragment --><p> C preprocessor conditional checks if the <b>vec_vadduqm</b> is defined in &lt;altivec.h&gt;. If defined we can assume that the compiler implements <b>__builtin_vec_vadduqm</b> and that &lt;altivec.h&gt; includes the macro definition:</p><div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="preprocessor">#define vec_vadduqm __builtin_vec_vadduqm</span></div></div><!-- fragment --><p> For <b>_ARCH_PWR7</b> and earlier we need a little grade school arithmetic using Vector Add Unsigned Word Modulo (<b>vadduwm</b>) and Vector Add and Write Carry-Out Unsigned Word (<b>vaddcuw</b>). This treats the vector __int128 as 4 32-bit binary digits. The first instruction sums each (32-bit digit) column and the second records the carry out of the high order bit. This leaves the carry bit in the original (word) column, so use a shift left to line up the carries with the next higher word.</p>
<p>To propagate any carries across all 4 (word) digits, repeat this (add / carry / shift) sequence three times. Then a final add modulo word to complete the 128-bit add. This sequence requires 10-11 instructions. The 11th instruction is a vector splat word 0 immediate, which in needed in the shift left (vsldoi) instructions. This is common in vector codes and the compiler can usually reuse this register across several blocks of code and inline functions.</p>
<p>For POWER7/8 these instructions are all 2 cycle latency and 2 per cycle throughput. The vadduwm / vaddcuw instruction pairs should issue in the same cycle and execute in parallel. So the expected latency for this sequence is 14 cycles. For POWER8 the vadduqm instruction has a 4 cycle latency.</p>
<p>Similarly for the carry / extend forms which can be combined to support wider (256, 512, 1024, ...) extended arithmetic. </p><dl class="section see"><dt>See also</dt><dd><a class="el" href="vec__int128__ppc_8h.html#ad7aaadba249ce46c4c94f78df1020da3" title="Vector Add &amp; write Carry Unsigned Quadword.

<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The <em>OpenPOWER ELF2 ABI</em> does define <b>bcd_mul10</b> which (from the description) will actually generate Decimal Shift (<b>bcds</b>).

As of this writing <b>bcd_mul10</b> support is not included in the latest GCC trunk source code.</dd></dl>
<p>For <b>_ARCH_PWR8</b> and earlier we need a little grade school arithmetic using <b>Vector Multiply Even/Odd Unsigned Halfword</b>. This treats the vector __int128 as 8 16-bit binary digits. We multiply each of these 16-bit digits by 10, which is done in two (even and odd) parts. The result is 4 32-bit (2 16-bit digits) partial products for the even digits and 4 32-bit products for the odd digits. The vector register (independent of endian); the even product elements are higher order and odd product elements are lower order.</p>
<p>The even digit partial products are offset right by 16-bits in the register. If we shift the even products left 1 (16-bit) digit, the even digits are lined up in columns with the odd digits. Now we can sum across partial products to get the final 128 bit product.</p>
<p>Notice also the conditional code for endian around the <b>vec_vmulouh</b> and <b>vec_vmuleuh</b> built-ins:</p><div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="preprocessor">#if __BYTE_ORDER__ == __ORDER_LITTLE_ENDIAN__</span></div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Little endian (<b>LE</b>) changes the element numbering. This also changes the meaning of even / odd and this effects the code generated by compilers. But the relationship of high and low order bytes, within multiplication products, is defined by the hardware and does not change. (See: <a class="el" href="index.html#mainpage_endian_issues_1_1">General Endian Issues</a>) So the pveclib implementation needs to pre-swap the even/odd partial product multiplies for LE. This in effect nullifies the even / odd swap hidden in the compilers <b>LE</b> code generation and the resulting code gives the correct results.</p>
<p>Now we are ready to sum the partial product <em>digits</em> while propagating the digit carries across the 128-bit product.

Returning extended quadword results.</h3>
<p>Extended quadword add, subtract and multiply results can exceed the width of a single 128-bit vector. A 128-bit add can produce 129-bit results. A unsigned 128-bit by 128-bit multiply result can produce 256-bit results. This is simplified for the <em>modulo</em> case where any result bits above the low order 128 can be discarded. But extended arithmetic requires returning the full precision result. Returning double wide quadword results are a complication for both RISC processor and C language library design.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" id="mainpage_sub_1_3_1"></a>
PowerISA and Implementation.</h4>
<p>For a RISC processor, encoding multiple return registers forces hard trade-offs in a fixed sized instruction format. Also building a vector register file that can support at least one (or more) double wide register writes per cycle is challenging. For a super-scalar machine with multiple vector execution pipelines, the processor can issue and complete multiple instructions per cycle. As most operations return single vector results, this is a higher priority than optimizing for double wide results.</p>
<p>The PowerISA addresses this by splitting these operations into two instructions that execute independently. Here independent means that given the same inputs, one instruction does not depend on the result of the other. Independent instructions can execute out-of-order, or if the processor has multiple vector execution pipelines, can execute (issue and complete) concurrently.</p>
<p>The original VMX implementation had Vector Add/Subtract Unsigned Word Modulo (<b>vadduwm</b> / <b>vsubuwm</b>), paired with Vector Add/Subtract and Write Carry-out Unsigned Word (<b>vaddcuw</b> / <b>vsubcuw</b>). Most usage ignores the carry-out and only uses the add/sub modulo instructions. Applications requiring extended precision, pair the add/sub modulo with add/sub write carry-out, to capture the carry and propagate it to higher order bits.</p>
<p>The (four word) carries are generated into the same <em>word lane</em> as the source addends and modulo result. Propagating the carries require a separate shift (to align the carry-out with the low order (carry-in) bit of the next higher word) and another add word modulo.</p>
<p>POWER8 (PowerISA 2.07B) added full Vector Add/Subtract Unsigned Quadword Modulo (<b>vadduqm</b> / <b>vsubuqm</b>) instructions, paired with corresponding Write Carry-out instructions. (<b>vaddcuq</b> / <b>vsubcuq</b>). A further improvement over the word instructions was the addition of three operand <em>Extend</em> forms which combine add/subtract with carry-in (<b>vaddeuqm</b>, <b>vsubeuqm</b>, <b>vaddecuq</b> and <b>vsubecuq</b>). This simplifies propagating the carry-out into higher quadword operations. </p><dl class="section see"><dt>See also</dt><dd><a class="el" href="vec__int128__ppc_8h.html#a539de2a4426a84102471306acc571ce8" title="Vector Add Unsigned Quadword Modulo.

<p>The VMX integer multiply operations are split into multiply even/odd instructions by element size. The product requires the next larger element size (twice as many bits). So a vector multiply byte would generate 16 halfword products (256-bits in total). Requiring separate even and odd multiply instructions cuts the total generated product bits (per instruction) in half. It also simplifies the hardware design by keeping the generated product in adjacent element lanes. So each vector multiply even or odd byte operation generates 8 halfword products (128-bits) per instruction.</p>
<p>This multiply even/odd technique applies to most element sizes from byte up to doubleword. The original VMX supports multiply even/odd byte and halfword operations. In the original VMX, arithmetic operations where restricted to byte, halfword, and word elements. Multiply halfword products fit within the integer word element. No multiply byte/halfword modulo instructions were provided, but could be implemented via a vmule, vmulo, vperm sequence.</p>
<p>POWER8 (PowerISA 2.07B) added multiply even/odd word and multiply modulo word instructions. </p><dl class="section see"><dt>See also</dt><dd><a class="el" href="vec__int32__ppc_8h.html#ac93f07d5ad73243db2771da83b50d6d8" title="Vector multiply even unsigned words.

<p>The latest PowerISA (3.0B for POWER9) does add a doubleword integer multiply via <b>Vector Multiply-Sum unsigned Doubleword Modulo</b>. This is a departure from the Multiply even/odd byte/halfword/word instructions available in earlier Power processors. But careful conditioning of the inputs can generate the equivalent of multiply even/odd unsigned doubleword. </p><dl class="section see"><dt>See also</dt><dd><a class="el" href="vec__int128__ppc_8h.html#a1d183ebd232e5826be109cdaa421aeed" title="Vector Multiply-Sum Unsigned Doubleword Modulo.

<p>This (multiply even/odd) technique breaks down when the input element size is quadword or larger. A quadword integer multiply forces a different split. The easiest next step would be a high/low split (like the Fixed-point integer multiply). A multiply low (modulo) quadword would be a useful function. Paired with multiply high quadword provides the double quadword product. This would provide the basis for higher (multi-quadword) precision multiplies. </p><dl class="section see"><dt>See also</dt><dd><a class="el" href="vec__int128__ppc_8h.html#a9aaaf0e4c2705be1e0e8e925b09c52de" title="Vector Multiply Low Unsigned Quadword.

<h4><a class="anchor" id="mainpage_sub_1_3_2"></a>
C Language restrictions.</h4>
<p>The Power Vector Library is implemented using C language (inline) functions and this imposes its own restrictions. Standard C language allows an arbitrary number of formal parameters and one return value per function. Parameters and return values with simple C types are normally transfered (passed / returned) efficiently in local (high performance) hardware registers. Aggregate types (struct, union, and arrays of arbitrary size) are normally handled by pointer indirection. The details are defined in the appropriate Application Binary Interface (ABI) documentation.</p>
<p>The POWER processor provides lots (96) of registers so we want to use registers wherever possible. Especially when our application is composed of collections of small functions. And more especially when these functions are small enough to inline and we want the compiler to perform local register allocation and common subexpression elimination optimizations across these functions. The PowerISA defines 3 kinds of registers;</p><ul>
<li>General Purpose Registers (GPRs),</li>
<li>Floating-point Registers (FPRs),</li>
<li>Vector registers (VRs),</li>
</ul>
<p>with 32 of each kind. We will ignore the various special registers for now.</p>
<p>The PowerPC64 64-bit ELF (and OpenPOWER ELF V2) ABIs normally pass simple arguments and return values in a single register (of the appropriate kind) per value. Arguments of aggregate types are passed as storage pointers in General Purpose Registers (GPRs).</p>
<p>The language specification, the language implementation, and the ABI provide some exceptions. The C99 language adds _Complex floating types which are composed of real and imaginary parts. GCC adds _Complex integer types. For PowerPC ABIs complex values are held in a pair of registers of the appropriate kind. C99 also adds double word integers as the <em>long long int</em> type. This only matters for PowerPC 32-bit ABIs. For PowerPC64 ABIs <em>long long</em> and <em>long</em> are both 64-bit integers and are held in 64-bit GPRs.</p>
<p>GCC also adds the __int128 type for some targets including the PowerPC64 ABIs. Values of __int128 type are held (for operations, parameter passing and function return) in 64-bit GPR pairs. GCC adds __ibm128 and _Decimal128 floating point types which are held in Floating-point Registers pairs. GCC recently added the __float128 floating point type which are held in single vector register. Similarly for vector __int128.</p>
<p>GCC defines Generic Vector Extensions that allow typedefs for vectors of various element sizes/types and generic SIMD (arithmetic, logical, and element indexing) operations. For PowerPC64 ABIs this is currently restricted to 16-byte vectors as defined in &lt;altivec.h&gt;. For currently available compilers attempts to define vector types with larger (32 or 64 byte) <em>vector_size</em> values are treated as arrays of scalar elements. Only vector_size(16) variables are passed and returned in vector registers.</p>
<p>The OpenPOWER 64-Bit ELF V2 ABI Specification makes specific provisions for passing/returning <em>homogeneous aggregates</em> of multiple like data types. Such aggregates can be passed as up to eight floating-point or vector registers. This is defined for the Little Endian ELF V2 ABI and is not applicable to Big Endian ELF V1 targets. Also current GCC versions, in common use, do not fully implement this ABI feature.</p>
<p>So we have shown that there are mechanisms for functions to return multiple vector register values. But none are really practical at this time as they not yet available (function or optimal code generation) in current GCC compilers, that are in common use.</p>
<p>Returning pairs of vector __int128 values as _Complex __float128 would be awkward at best. And it is not clear when or if _Complex vector __int128 will be supported. GCC's Generic Vector Extensions are only implemented for vector_size(16). And current GCC compilers can generate some sub-optimal code for passing/returning <em>homogeneous aggregates</em> as suggested in the OpenPOWER ABI.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" id="mainpage_sub_1_3_3"></a>
Subsetting the problem.</h4>
<p>We can simplify this problem by remembering that:</p><ul>
<li>Only a subset of the pveclib functions need to return more than one 128-bit vector.</li>
<li>The PowerISA normally splits these cases into multiple instructions anyway.</li>
<li>So far these functions are small and fully inlined.</li>
</ul>
<p>So we have two (or three) options given the current state of GCC compilers in common use:</p><ul>
<li>Mimic the PowerISA and split the operation into two functions, where each function only returns (up to) 128-bits of the result.</li>
<li>Use pointer parameters to return a second vector value in addition to the function return.</li>
<li>Support both and let the user decide which works best.</li>
</ul>
<p>The add/subtract quadword operations provide good examples. For exmaple adding two 256-bit unsigned integer values and returning the 257-bit (the high / low sum and the carry)result looks like this:</p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">s1 = vec_vadduqm (a1, b1); <span class="comment">// sum low 128-bits a1+b1</span></div><div class="line">c1 = vec_vaddcuq (a1, b1); <span class="comment">// write-carry from low a1+b1</span></div><div class="line">s0 = vec_vaddeuqm (a0, b0, c1); <span class="comment">// Add-extend high 128-bits a0+b0+c1</span></div><div class="line">c0 = vec_vaddecuq (a0, b0, c1); <span class="comment">// write-carry from high a0+b0+c1</span></div></div><!-- fragment --><p> This sequence uses the built-ins from &lt;altivec.h&gt; and generates instructions that will execute on POWER8 and POWER9. The compiler must target POWER8 (-mcpu=power8) or higher. In fact the compile will fail if the target is POWER7.</p>
<p>Now let's look at the pveclib version of these operations from &lt;<a class="el" href="vec__int128__ppc_8h.html" title="Header package containing a collection of 128-bit computation functions implemented with PowerISA VMX...">vec_int128_ppc.h</a>&gt;:</p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">s1 = <a class="code" href="vec__int128__ppc_8h.html#a539de2a4426a84102471306acc571ce8">vec_adduqm</a> (a1, b1); <span class="comment">// sum low 128-bits a1+b1</span></div><div class="line">c1 = <a class="code" href="vec__int128__ppc_8h.html#ad7aaadba249ce46c4c94f78df1020da3">vec_addcuq</a> (a1, b1); <span class="comment">// write-carry from low a1+b1</span></div><div class="line">s0 = <a class="code" href="vec__int128__ppc_8h.html#a44e63f70b182d60fe03b43a80647451a">vec_addeuqm</a> (a0, b0, c1); <span class="comment">// Add-extend high 128-bits a0+b0+c1</span></div><div class="line">c0 = <a class="code" href="vec__int128__ppc_8h.html#af18b98d2d73f1afbc439e1407c78f305">vec_addecuq</a> (a0, b0, c1); <span class="comment">// write-carry from high a0+b0+c1</span></div></div><!-- fragment --><p> Looks almost the same but the operations do not use the 'v' prefix on the operation name. This sequence generates the same instructions for (-mcpu=power8) as the &lt;altivec.h&gt; version above. It will also generate a different (slightly longer) instruction sequence for (-mcpu=power7) which is functionally equivalent.</p>
<p>The pveclib &lt;<a class="el" href="vec__int128__ppc_8h.html" title="Header package containing a collection of 128-bit computation functions implemented with PowerISA VMX...">vec_int128_ppc.h</a>&gt; header also provides a coding style alternative:</p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">s1 = <a class="code" href="vec__int128__ppc_8h.html#a363fa7103ccd730c47bb34cb9f05e80b">vec_addcq</a> (&amp;c1, a1, b1);</div><div class="line">s0 = <a class="code" href="vec__int128__ppc_8h.html#a9e27910c148d525e17d099688aec9ba1">vec_addeq</a> (&amp;c0, a0, b0, c1);</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> Here vec_addcq combines the adduqm/addcuq operations into a <em>add and carry quadword</em> operation. The first parameter is a pointer to vector to receive the carry-out while the 128-bit modulo sum is the function return value. Similarly vec_addeq combines the addeuqm/addecuq operations into a <em>add with extend and carry quadword</em> operation.</p>
<p>As these functions are inlined by the compiler the implied store / reload of the carry can be converted into a simple register assignment. For (-mcpu=power8) the compiler should generate the same instruction sequence as the two previous examples.</p>
<p>For (-mcpu=power7) these functions will expand into a different (slightly longer) instruction sequence which is functionally equivalent to the instruction sequence generated for (-mcpu=power8).</p>
<p>For older processors (power7 and earlier) and under some circumstances instructions generated for this "combined form" may perform better than the "split form" equivalent from the second example. Here the compiler may not recognize all the common subexpressions, as the "split forms" are expanded before optimization.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="mainpage_sub2"></a>
Background on the evolution  of &lt;altivec.h&gt;</h2>
<p>The original <a href="https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/reference-manual/ALTIVECPIM.pdf">AltiVec (TM) Technology Programming Interface Manual</a> defined the minimal vector extensions to the application binary interface (ABI), new keywords (vector, pixel, bool) for defining new vector types, and new operators (built-in functions).</p>
<ul>
<li>generic AltiVec operations, like vec_add()</li>
<li>specific AltiVec operations (instructions, like vec_addubm())</li>
<li>predicates computed from a AltiVec operation like vec_all_eq()</li>
</ul>
<p>A generic operation generates specific instructions based on the types of the actual parameters. So a generic vec_add operation, with vector char parameters, will generate the (specific) vector add unsigned byte modulo (vaddubm) instruction. Predicates are used within if statement conditional clauses to access the condition code from vector operations that set Condition Register 6 (vector SIMD compares and Decimal Integer arithmetic and format conversions).</p>
<p>The PIM defined a set of compiler built-ins for vector instructions (see section "4.4 Generic and Specific AltiVec Operations") that compilers should support. The document suggests that any required typedefs and supporting macro definitions be collected into an include file named &lt;altivec.h&gt;.</p>
<p>The built-ins defined by the PIM closely match the vector instructions of the underlying PowerISA. For example: vec_mul, vec_mule / vec_mulo, and vec_muleub / vec_muloub.</p><ul>
<li>vec_mul is defined for float and double and will (usually) generate a single instruction for the type. This is a simpler case as floating point operations usually stay in their lanes (result elements are the same size as the input operand elements).</li>
<li>vec_mule / vec_mulo (multiply even / odd) are defined for integer multiply as integer products require twice as many bits as the inputs (the results don't stay in their lane). <dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>The RISC philosophy resists and POWER Architecture avoids instructions that write to more than one register. So the hardware and PowerISA vector integer multiply generate even and odd product results (from even and odd input elements) from two instructions executing separately. The PIM defines and compiler supports these operations as overloaded built-ins and selects the specific instructions based on the operand (char or short) type.</dd></dl>
This is complicated as the PowerISA evolves. The original Altivec (VMX) provided vector multiply (even / odd) operations for byte (char) and halfword (short) integers. Multiple even / odd word (int) instructions were not introduced until PowerISA V2.07 (POWER8). PowerISA 2.07 also introduced vector multiply word modulo which is included under the generic vec_mul.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the PowerISA evolved adding new vector (VMX) instructions, new facilities (Vector Scalar Extended (VSX)), and specialized vector categories (little endian, AES, SHA2, RAID), these new operators were added to &lt;altivec.h&gt;. This included new specific and generic operations and additional vector element types (long (64-bit) int, __int128, double and quad precision (__Float128) float).</p>
<p>However the PIM documents were primarily focused on embedded processors and were not updated to include the vector extensions implemented by the server processors. So any documentation for new vector operations were relegated to the various compilers. This was a haphazard process and some divergence in operation naming did occur between compilers.</p>
<p>In the run up to the POWER8 launch and the OpenPOWER initiative it was recognized that switching to Little Endian would require and new and well documented Application Binary Interface (<b>ABI</b>). It was also recognized that new &lt;altivec.h&gt; extensions needed to be documented in a common place so the various compilers could implement a common vector built-in API. So ...</p>
<p>The <a href="https://openpowerfoundation.org/?resource_lib=64-bit-elf-v2-abi-specification-power-architecture">OpenPOWER ELF V2 application binary interface (ABI)</a>: Chapter 6. Vector Programming Interfaces and Appendix A. Predefined Functions for Vector Programming document the current and proposed vector built-ins we expect all C/C++ compilers to implement for the PowerISA.</p>
<p>The ABI also defines many overloaded built-in functions as generic operations. Here the compiler selects a specific PowerISA implementation based on the operand (vector element) types. The ABI also defines the (big/little) endian behavior and the compiler may select different instructions based on the endianness of the target.</p>
<p>Also note that the vector element numbering changes between big and little endian, and so does the meaning of even and odd. Both affect what the compiler supports and the instruction sequence generated.</p><ul>
<li><b>vec_muleub</b> and <b>vec_muloub</b> (multiply even / odd unsigned byte) are examples of non-overloaded built-ins provided by the GCC compiler but not defined in the ABI. One would assume these built-ins will generate the matching instruction, however the GCC compiler will adjust the generated instruction based on the target endianness (even / odd is reversed for little endian).</li>
</ul>
<p>The ABI also defines vec_mul as an overloaded operation on integer types, where only the low order half (modulo element size) of the product is returned. The PowerISA does not provide direct multiply modulo instructions for all the integer sizes / types. So this requires a multiple-instruction sequence to implement. Also integer vec_mul is defined in the ABI as "phased in" and is only implemented in the latest GCC versions.</p>
<p>This is a small sample of the complexity we encounter programming at this low level (vector intrinsic) API. Partially this is due to RISC design philosophy where there is a trade-off of software complexity for simpler (hopefully faster) hardware design.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="mainpage_sub3"></a>
pveclib is not a vector math library</h2>
<p>The pveclib does not implement general purpose vector math operations. These should continue to be developed and improved within existing projects (ie LAPACK, OpenBLAS, ATLAS and libmvec).</p>
<p>We believe that pveclib will be helpful to implementors of vector math libraries by providing a higher level, more portable, and more consistent vector interface for the PowerISA. Similarly for implementors of extended arithmetic, cryptographic, compression/decompression, and pattern matching / search libraries.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="perf_data"></a>
Performance data.</h1>
<p>It is useful to provide basic performance data for each pveclib function. This is challenging as these functions are small and intended to be in-lined within larger functions (algorithms). As such they are subject to both the compiler's instruction scheduling and common subexpression optimizations plus the processors super-scalar and out-of-order execution design features.</p>
<p>As pveclib functions are normally only a few instructions, the actual timing will depend on the context it is in (the instructions that it depends on for data and instructions that proceed them in the pipelines).</p>
<p>The simplest approach is to use the same performance metrics as the Power Processor Users Manuals Performance Profile. This is normally per instruction latency in cycles and throughput in instructions issued per cycle. There may also be additional information for special conditions that may apply.</p>
<p>For example the vector float absolute value function. For recent PowerISA implementations this a single (VSX <b>xvabssp</b>) instruction which we can look up in the POWER8 / POWER9 Processor User's Manuals (<b>UM</b>).</p>
<table class="doxtable">
<tr>
<th align="right">processor</th><th align="center">Latency</th><th align="left">Throughput  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td align="right">power8 </td><td align="center">6-7 </td><td align="left">2/cycle </td></tr>
<tr>
<td align="right">power9 </td><td align="center">2 </td><td align="left">2/cycle </td></tr>
</table>
<p>The POWER8 UM specifies a latency of <em>"6 cycles to FPU (+1 cycle to other VSU ops"</em> for this class of VSX single precision FPU instructions. So the minimum latency is 6 cycles if the register result is input to another VSX single precision FPU instruction. Otherwise if the result is input to a VSU logical or integer instruction then the latency is 7 cycles. The POWER9 UM shows the pipeline improvement of 2 cycles latency for simple FPU instructions like this. Both processors support dual pipelines for a 2/cycle throughput capability.</p>

The vector abs would work for this, but we know from the example above that this instruction has a high latency as we are definitely passing the result to a non-FPU instruction (vector compare greater than unsigned word).</p>
<p>So the code needs to load two constant vectors masks, then vector and-compliment to clear the sign-bit, before comparing each word for greater then infinity. The generated code should look something like this:</p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">addis   r9,r2,.rodata.cst16+0x10@ha</div><div class="line">addis   r10,r2,.rodata.cst16+0x20@ha</div><div class="line">addi    r9,r9,.rodata.cst16+0x10@l</div><div class="line">addi    r10,r10,.rodata.cst16+0x20@l</div><div class="line">lvx     v0,0,r10  # load vector <span class="keyword">const</span> signmask</div><div class="line">lvx     v12,0,r9  # load vector <span class="keyword">const</span> expmask</div><div class="line">xxlandc vs34,vs34,vs32</div><div class="line">vcmpgtuw v2,v2,v12</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> So six instructions to load the const masks and two instructions for the actual vec_isnanf32 function. The first six instructions are only needed once for each containing function, can be hoisted out of loops and into the function prologue, can be <em>commoned</em> with the same constant for other pveclib functions, or executed out-of-order and early by the processor.</p>
<p>Most of the time, constant setup does not contribute measurably to the over all performance of vec_isnanf32. When it does it is limited by the longest (in cycles latency) of the various independent paths that load constants. In this case the const load sequence is composed of three pairs of instructions that can issue and execute in parallel. The addis/addi FXU instructions supports throughput of 6/cycle and the lvx load supports 2/cycle. So the two vector constant load sequences can execute in parallel and the latency is same as a single const load.</p>
<p>For POWER8 it appears to be (2+2+5=) 9 cycles latency for the const load. While the core vec_isnanf32 function (xxlandc/vcmpgtuw) is a dependent sequence and runs (2+2) 4 cycles latency. Similar analysis for POWER9 where the addis/addi/lvx sequence is still listed as (2+2+5) 9 cycles latency. While the xxlandc/vcmpgtuw sequence increases to (2+3) 5 cycles.</p>
<p>The next interesting question is what can we say about throughput (if anything) for this example. The thought experiment is "what
  would happen if?";</p><ul>
<li>two or more instances of vec_isnanf32 are used within a single function,</li>
<li>in close proximity in the code,</li>

We see that the code is generated only once for each constant. Then the compiler generate the core vec_isnanf32 function four times and interleaves the instructions. This enables parallel pipeline execution where conditions allow. Finally the 16X isnan results are reduced to 8X, then 4X, then to a single condition code.</p>
<p>For this exercise we will ignore the constant load as in any realistic usage it will be <em>commoned</em> across several pveclib functions and hoisted out of any loops. The reduction code is not part of the vec_isnanf32 implementation and also ignored. The sequence of 4X xxlandc and 4X vcmpgtuw in the middle it the interesting part.</p>
<p>For POWER8 both xxlandc and vcmpgtuw are listed as 2 cycles latency and throughput of 2 per cycle. So we can assume that (only) the first two xxlandc will issue in the same cycle (assuming the input vectors are ready). The issue of the next two xxlandc instructions will be delay by 1 cycle. The following vcmpgtuw instruction are dependent on the xxlandc results and will not execute until their input vectors are ready. The first two vcmpgtuw instruction will execute 2 cycles (latency) after the first two xxlandc instructions execute. Execution of the second two vcmpgtuw instructions will be delayed 1 cycle due to the issue delay in the second pair of xxlandc instructions.</p>
<p>So at least for this example and this set of simplifying assumptions we suggest that the throughput metric for vec_isnanf32 is 2/cycle. For latency metric we offer the range with the latency for the core function (without and constant load overhead) first. Followed by the total latency (the sum of the constant load and core function latency). For the vec_isnanf32 example the metrics are:</p>

<p>The generated POWER8 code looks like this:</p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">addis   r10,r2,-2</div><div class="line">addis   r8,r2,-2</div><div class="line">addi    r10,r10,21184</div><div class="line">addi    r8,r8,-13760</div><div class="line">addis   r9,r2,-2</div><div class="line">lvx     v13,0,r8</div><div class="line">addi    r9,r9,21200</div><div class="line">lvx     v1,0,r10</div><div class="line">lvx     v0,0,r9</div><div class="line">xxland  vs33,vs33,vs34</div><div class="line">xxlandc vs34,vs45,vs34</div><div class="line">vcmpgtuw v0,v0,v1</div><div class="line">vcmpequw v2,v2,v13</div><div class="line">xxlnor  vs34,vs32,vs34</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> Note this this sequence needs to load 3 vector constants. In previous examples we have noted that POWER8 lvx supports 2/cycle throughput. But with good scheduling, the 3rd vector constant load, will only add 1 additional cycle to the timing (10 cycles).</p>
<p>Once the constant masks are loaded the xxland/xxlandc instructions can execute in parallel. The vcmpgtuw/vcmpequw can also execute in parallel but are delayed waiting for the results of masking operations. Finally the xxnor is dependent on the data from both compare instructions.</p>
<p>For POWER8 the latencies are 2 cycles each, and assuming parallel execution of xxland/xxlandc and vcmpgtuw/vcmpequw we can assume (2+2+2=) 6 cycles minimum latency and another 10 cycles for the constant loads (if needed).</p>
<p>While the POWER8 core has ample resources (10 issue ports across 16 execution units), this specific sequence is restricted to the two <em>issue ports and VMX execution units</em> for this class of (simple vector integer and logical) instructions. For vec_isnormalf32 this allows for a lower latency (6 cycles vs the expected 10, over 5 instructions), it also implies that both of the POWER8 cores <em>VMX execution units</em> are busy for 2 out of the 6 cycles.</p>
<p>So while the individual instructions have can have a throughput of 2/cycle, vec_isnormalf32 can not. It is plausible for two executions of vec_isnormalf32 to interleave with a delay of 1 cycle for the second sequence. To keep the table information simple for now, just say the throughput of vec_isnormalf32 is 1/cycle.</p>
<p>After that it gets complicated. For example after the first two instances of vec_isnormalf32 are issued, both <em>VMX execution units</em> are busy for 4 cycles. So either the first instructions of the third vec_isnormalf32 will be delayed until the fifth cycle. Or the compiler scheduler will interleave instructions across the instances of vec_isnormalf32 and the latencies of individual vec_isnormalf32 results will increase. This is too complicated to put in a simple table.</p>
<p>For POWER9 the sequence is slightly different</p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">addis   r10,r2,-2</div><div class="line">addis   r9,r2,-2</div><div class="line">xvabssp vs45,vs34</div><div class="line">addi    r10,r10,-14016</div><div class="line">addi    r9,r9,-13920</div><div class="line">lvx     v1,0,r10</div><div class="line">lvx     v0,0,r9</div><div class="line">xxland  vs34,vs34,vs33</div><div class="line">vcmpgtuw v0,v0,v13</div><div class="line">vcmpequw v2,v2,v1</div><div class="line">xxlnor  vs34,vs32,vs34</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> We use vec_abs (xvabssp) to replace the sigmask and vec_andc and so only need to load two vector constants. So the constant load overhead is reduced to 9 cycles. However the the vector compares are now 3 cycles for (2+3+2=) 7 cycles for the core sequence. The final table for vec_isnormalf32:</p>

Additional analysis and tools.</h2>
<p>The overview above is simplified analysis based on the instruction latency and throughput numbers published in the Processor User's Manuals (see <a class="el" href="index.html#mainpage_ref_docs">Reference Documentation</a>). These values are <em>best case</em> (input data is ready, SMT1 mode, no cache misses, mispredicted branches, or other hazards) for each instruction in isolation.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>This information is intended as a guide for compiler and application developers wishing to optimize for the platform. Any performance tables provided for pveclib functions are in this spirit.</dd></dl>
<p>Of course the actual performance is complicated by the overall environment and how the pveclib functions are used. It would be unusual for pveclib functions to be used in isolation. The compiler will in-line pveclib functions and look for sub-expressions it can hoist out of loops or share across pveclib function instances. The The compiler will also model the processor and schedule instructions across the larger containing function. So in actual use the instruction sequences for the examples above are likely to be interleaved with instructions from other pvevlib functions and user written code.</p>
<p>Larger functions that use pveclib and even some of the more complicated pveclib functions (like vec_muludq) defy simple analysis. For these cases it is better to use POWER specific analysis tools. To understand the overall pipeline flows and identify hazards the instruction trace driven performance simulator is recommended.</p>
